### ☄️ What's next?

Airdrop marketplace will be in beta since there’s a high demand for this, We already have 5 thousand people waiting for this product subscribed to our newsletter specifically for this but for now it will only be accessible to our early adopters and early users which is around 3 thousand users. The plan is to launch this with Morph mainnet and go live with a big campaign.
